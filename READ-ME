#Project 3: due on June 10 (by end of the day)
  Glycolysis is the biochemical process by which living cells break down sugars to release
  energy, which is used to form Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP). The complete glycolytic pathway
  is a complex series of ten enzyme-catalyzed reactions, involving intermediates that are
  derivatives of common sugars like fructose and glucose. Here, we wish to examine glycolytic
  oscillations that arise is one of these intermediate processes that relate ATP and Fructose-6-
  phosphate (F6P).
  By measuring the concentrations of ATP and F6P in yeast and muscle extracts, scientists have
  demonstrated that their rates of change depend nonlinearly on the current concentration of the
  other. A simplified model for this part of glycolysis is:
      d[ATP]/dt = − [ATP] + a[F6P] + [ATP]^2[F6P]
      d[F6P]/dt = b − a[F6P] − [ATP]^2[F6P]
      
    where square brackets denote concentrations (typically detected by proxy using fluorescence).
    Here, and are kinetic constants that depend on other intermediates and external factors like
    the temperature. For simplicity, we will assume that all terms are in dimensionless units.
    
      a) Numerically solve the system of ODEs for a = 0.05 and b = 1.2 until if the initial
         concentrations are [ATP] = 1 and [F6P] = 1 . Plot this solution with correct labels. Does
         the eventual steady state concentration depend on initial conditions?
      b)  Experiments often observe the so-called ‘glycolytic oscillator’ where the concentrations
          oscillate for several minutes. Use the same initial conditions as part (a) with constant a = 0.05. 
           However,b = 1.2 in the beginning like before but changes to b = 0.8 at t=30. Solve and plot the concentrations up to
           t=100.
      c) The kinetic parameters are often not constant, and change continuously depending on the
         surrounding environment, temperature, and other intermediate products. In a particular
         case, let’s say you discover that while (a) is mostly a constant, the parameter (b) changes
         continuously with time as follows:
                  db/dt = − 0.1[F6P][ATP]e^(−1/b)
        
            Now solve and plot the concentrations of ATP and F6P up to t = 100 if a = 0.05 and the
            initial values are [ATP] =1 , [F6P] = 1 and b =1.
